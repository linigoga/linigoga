Hello! My name is Lucas Ivan Inigo Gamiz, I am a post-doctoral researcher at Instituto Superior Tecnico. My research focus in in high-field physics and applications of quantum computing to plasma physics. 

My Ph.D. topic is in the theoretical study of streaming plasma instabilities, mainly the current filamentation and two-stream instability. In this, 
I've developed analytical formulations and prove these using numerical methods. I use mainly python to perform my data analysis and calculations.

Currently, I am very interested in Machine and Deep Learning. I have obtained a deep learning specialization certificate on Coursera, and in my spare time
I practice DL with simple projects found in Kaggle. 

In this GitHub, I'll post some of the analysis scripts that I have made, and may upload some DL and data analysis projects I have done.
